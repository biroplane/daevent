Even if it is since 1964, thanks to the movie [**“Marriage Italian style”**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Italian_Style) of the great filmmaker Vittorio De Sica, with **Sophia Loren** and **Marcello Mastroianni** as protagonists, that the words **wedding and Italy** have been declared famous all over the world, in the last years the **trend wedding destination Italy** or the more specific research of **wedding venues in Apulia** (or in Italian: Puglia) and in other Italian regions is in constant growth.

### Good reasons to get married in Apulia

In this article, also thanks to the experience started in 2002 ad **DJ for weddings in Apulia**, if from abroad you are searching online for good information, I’ll try to give you good and concrete **reasons that make this region in Southern Italy** an **ideal location for the most exclusive wedding destination**. Here you can read [**another post**](https://www.daeventpuglia.it/en/wedding-destination-dj-live-music-and-light-show-in-apulia-and-southern-italy/) about the perfect wedding party’s organization.

A good idea for the wedding destination almost all year round
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you are wondering about the best period for your wedding in Italy, Apulia – unlike the regions in the north – has a **pleasant climate for most part of the year**. At maximum there can be colder temperatures between November and February, but **from spring up to the end of October** it will astonish you for its **light and the full light blue sky**, in contrast with the **white of the stone** that constitute most part of the **most beautiful venues**. I would recommend choosing it in August carefully… because, over the high temperatures, this is the hottest season also in terms of **arrival of tourists from all over the world**!

Wedding destination in Apulia: a good reason for new and unforgettable holidays
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Among the reasons that make **Apulia one of the top ideas for wedding destinations**, there is to say that some future spouses have discovered it **just during their holidays** and now they would like to have a **long weekend or a whole week or more time** to get back to the same enchanting places, with friends and the closes relatives, just in the occasion of their wedding.

### The perfect location where to extend the duration of a wedding

Traditionally, **weddings in Apulia are very long** for those who live here, because they **start in the morning and dances can last all night long**, above all if the DJ set is **among those who will not let you leave the dancefloor for at least 3 or 4 hours**!!! That is why i twill be more than natural to add a **pre-party on the day before the wedding**, even for a **romantic serenate**, as well as for a special day on the day after, starting from a suggestive **excursion, brunch or dinner** in other **typical places of the local culture**.

### Apulia: almost 900 km of coasts between two seas!

A simple landscape, that conquers your soul at a glance, this is Apulia: **the white of some towns**, the **light blue of the sky** and the **green of a country rich of delicious products**. Kilometres and kilometres among **vineyards, olive groves, almond trees, figs and prickly pears**. A world of **ancestral traditions**, still alive, among places where sometimes it seems that time is magically standing still. The **landscapes, the beaches and the crystal-clear waters of Salento**; the incredible **Trulli of Alberobello**; the charm of **Valle d’Itria**; the magic of **Polignano a Mare** and other mysterious and marvellous places, to discover accompanied by excellent food you will never forget.

Wedding venues in Apulia, why is the wedding destination in Apulia a good idea?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Resorts and venues for weddings in Apulia**, in particular in the **most ancient farmhouses and historical villas** that will seem to be locations always existed to host this kind of parties, seen the **very natural contest** in which friends and relatives will feel perfectly at home. Usually some structures are **equipped to host up to almost 60-70 guests**, with the maximum comfort and in any case there are **other places where to accommodate**.

What is a farmhouse? (Italian: Masseria)
----------------------------------------

The farmhouse (masseria) is a **typical fortified colonial house** characterising the history of the **Apulian countryside since the large estates**. Some of them date back to **1500 or 1600**: usually they have a **first floor destined to the manor house**, of the landowner, while **the ground floor is divided between the accommodations for farmers, the spaces destined to animals** (stables and barns) and those for **chariots and work tools**.  
Thanks to skilful renovation works that have preserved their structures and **many original material**, today there are farmhouses that are rediscovering a new life offering **the best natural frame either as wedding destination** with a limited number of guests and for **luxury events** even for an important number of participants.

#### Natural photo shoot with the unique light of Apulia

Incredible miles of countryside, or karst rock or sea out of sight: these are only some of the possible landscapes that will make your photos more suggestive. **All this and much more is wedding destination in Apulia** with the most **incredible glimpses of enchanted towns**, with their **white roads** in which walking for **the pure pleasure to get lost and find yourselves** suddenly in front of a square or a breath-taking church.

### How long before do we have to make a reservation for a wedding destination in Apulia?

Even if **in Apulia there are lots of high-level venues**, it is important to **move in advance**, no less than **one year before**, but often it is better **also 18 or 24 months or even before**, but this depends on the quality and the reputation of the venue!!!  
I suggest, even if it should be obvious not living in Italy, to **rely on a wedding planner** with a specific **experience on wedding destinations in Apulia**.  
You can decide to **entrust the wedding planner the whole organization** or choose to reserve the **most artistic part, watching online the work of photographers and video makers**, as watching videos relevant to the **musical part**, in case of **live bands or of single musicians or if you are looking for a DJ** just like me.

> “Danilo, thank you so much for all of your good work! Everyone was telling us how amazing the DJ was 🔥 you had us all dancing all night and we really appreciate how good you made our evening! The speakers at the pool party were great and thanks for organising that for us!  
> **– Michael Dykes, 1 November 2022, wedding at Masseria San Giovanni, Fasano, Italy**
> 
> “Big thank you to Danilo and his team for a wedding party we (and our guests) will never forget! A true professional and master of his craft, my wife and I cannot recommend him more. If you’re getting married in Puglia, he is your man!”  
> **– Rob Caucci, 28 October 2022, wedding in Taranto, Puglia, Italy**
> 
> “It was truly the best party of our lives! Danilo was there for us throughout the whole process – he was so kind, fun and professional to interact with. At our wedding, he was there from before the ceremony until the last guest went home. We cannot thank him enough. We also booked his saxophonist who was unbelievable – he was the perfect addition to Danilo’s DJ set. All in all, it was perfection!”  
> **– Chloe Marchese, 2 October 2022, wedding in Bari, Italy**
> 
> “For me, music is the most important element to a wedding, or any party. That’s why it was crucial we find the best DJ for our wedding. We trusted our gut with Danilo, and we are so happy with our decision. We had a mixed American-Iranian wedding, so naturally I was worried we couldn’t find the right fit to incorporate Persian music. I am so glad we went to DJ Danilo, as he beautifully mixed the music and kept the party going all night. He was such a pleasure to work with! Always responded to my messages in a timely manner, always so nice, and constantly reassuring me that the music will be great. He was right! Everyone has been talking about the DJ and his music every since! I highly recommend DJ Danilo, you won’t regret it!”  
> **– Sarah Borghei, 20 September 2022, wedding at Masseria San Giovanni, Fasano, Puglia, Italy**
