In this article you will find **very useful tips about the artistic organization of a wedding destination in Italy with an expert DJ, musicians and the live bands you will optionally choose**, together with the **most suitable light show** to give the right colours to the party you have in mind.

### From the wedding ceremony to the wedding party: which artists to choose? Why is it important to have an audio and light service really up to the task?

If you are already wondering about **your wedding destination in Apulia**, maybe in a **typical farmhouse** I have told you about [**in this article**](https://www.daeventpuglia.it/en/why-is-apulia-among-the-best-wedding-destinations-in-italy/), and you were searching for a focus on **how to artistically arrange the several moments of the party**, I am sure that this page will help you to have a pretty good idea.

Hence, let’s start from the solution you already have in mind: **a dreamy venue in Apulia** and the **four main moments to organize in detail with DJ Danny’s music** and the **several artistic and musical proposals** of his Team.

#### First of all: the starting time

Is the ceremony planned at 11 a.m., 4 or 5 p.m.? It means that **DJ Danny and the audio service will reach the venue two hours before the event**. This will allow **organizing the whole technical part well in advance**: the equipment will be installed well before the arrival of the guests, who will not see cables out of place, and **will be removed only at the end of the event or when the guests have left each area**.

#### Solution 1: music commissioned to the DJ

The right sound and DJ for the ceremony in Italy in a great wedding destination
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case you will choose to commission the music direction of the most important and solemn moments to the DJ, **he will design the most suitable sound for these moments**:

*   arrival of the guests
*   entrance of the groom
*   entrance of the bride
*   exchange of rings
*   exit of the newlyweds

Usually the music choice for these moments is already in the newlyweds’ minds, but **I will be happy to help you in case of doubts** on the most suitable song for a particular moment or to suggest you other tips according to your inputs and to the type of atmosphere you would like to create. Here you can find [**a detailed article**](https://www.daeventpuglia.it/en/why-is-apulia-among-the-best-wedding-destinations-in-italy/) about the best Apulia wedding destinations.

### An important detail even for music during the ceremony!

Even if it may seem banal (but, I promise you, it’s never like that!) for each moment of the ceremony, **every single technical aspect will be treated in detail, starting from amplification**. As a matter of fact it will be managed by the technicians of our audio service who – for each point you will use in the venue – **will provide a dedicated system, including radio microphone and signal management mixer**.

Everything is cabled and placed in an excellent way (almost invisible) hence cables will not hinder your guests, the sound system is installed far from the celebrant to avoid… the typical and annoying glitches: **Larsen or any other audio problem will be carefully avoided**. According to the aesthetics of the venue, **you can also choose a white sound system** that, over an enveloping sound quality, will be perfectly integrated and more than appreciated in the aesthetics of the whole scenario.

Music for aperitif
------------------

The music selection for aperitif is actively managed by the DJ. Even in this case it is possible to **customize the musical style** that will be proposed: the aim is to **be present at the service** in a moment of conversation or simple observation and familiarization with spaces, with low volumes and extreme elegance. Even here, useless to repeat it, the audio setting will be characterised by **quality equipment and the maximum of good taste in the placement of the technical devices**.

Dinner, among weeding speeches and customized listening music
-------------------------------------------------------------

During dinner, we are used to **coordinate the programme of the several wedding speeches of friends and relatives**, alternating with moments of listening music, always with the possibility to customize the musical genre according to the newlyweds’ tastes and specific themes chosen for the party. Even in this case, **the technicians of the audio service will provide audio system, two radio microphones and a signal management mixer, and their expertise and attention for volume adjusting**.

Wedding Party: music and lights
-------------------------------

At the arrival to the wedding party, at the end of the dinner, we propose first of all **an important change of scenery**, thanks to **four different light installations**:

1.  Titan

### The several stage and lights installations

2\. White

3\. White and mirror ball

### Last but not least…

4\. Diamond stage

### Led version

4\. Diamond stage & Led

**Each installation can be clearly reconfigured** and suitable to the newlyweds’ needs, considering **also the general aesthetic aspect** that has to be **in perfect harmony with the style of the venue**.

At the level of audio power, our technicians will choose **the best possible system** according to the **total number of guests and the size of the dancefloor**.

**Music will be totally tailor-made**: the indications of the newlyweds will match in a special way with the twenty-year experience of a DJ who is in **continuous technical and stylistic evolution, for a unique DJ set and a party to remember**.

Solution 2: inclusion of live music and show
--------------------------------------------

Here’s a second solution, **more complete and rich of live music and show**!  
The dedication and the attention on the arrival time and the technical aspect remain unchanged towards the first solution: technicians and artists **will reach the venue two hours before and the sound systems will be installed and arranged before the arrival of guests**.

### Wedding ceremony with live music

Several artistic proposals can enrich this very exciting moment. Some of the possibilities:

*   duet composed by **guitar and voice**;
*   **trio or string quartet**;
*   **solo violinist or with harpist**.

### Music and show for aperitif

This moment already announces the beginning of the party, important preview of the rest. Here you are some of the best artistic proposals for a very first and pretty cool wow-effect:

*   **Live Pizzica** (show of live dance and music in total Apulian style)
*   **Dixieland band**
*   **Swing trio or quartet**
*   **Street Art** (juggling, fire eaters and much more…)
*   **Saxophonist** (instrumental proposal on several music genres)

### Ideas for show of music during the wedding dinner

During dinner, among the speeches and the dedications of relatives and friends in alternation with moments of listening music, in this case you can customise and furtherly animate the musical genre, opting for live interventions of artists of this type:

*   Pizzica dancers
*   Dance swing group
*   Two or three tenors who play famous aria
*   Duo guitar and voice

We will clearly ensure that **each performance is well coordinated at level of timing and in perfect harmony with the dinner service**.

Wedding Party with DJ set and live music guests
-----------------------------------------------

At this point I can propose you all the best, in only one solution for a party to remember:

*   **DJ Danny Howen**
*   **Diamond lights installation**
*   **Live sax and percussion**
*   **Vocalist** (wide choice of singers) and/or **other musicians or dancers**

In the artists section you can learn more about the variety of solutions suggested.
